# Basic Image Processing Library

We implemented an image processing library using the C programming language. The goal of this project is to implement useful image processing functionality so we used open source C code  to load and save the images. We used these save/load files to save us the trouble of writing it ourselves which increased development speed. This library can apply various filters, count and return connected black regions, create a feature vector based on a normalized ratio of black to white pixels, incorrectly thin and recognize digits.
